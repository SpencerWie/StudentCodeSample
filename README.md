# StudentCodeSample

This is a Sample Code Project to demonstrate a basic CRUD application with JavaScript [React](https://reactjs.org/) on the front-end and Java ([Spring](https://spring.io/)) on the back-end. This application was made to be cloned and easily executed without having to setup any additional dependencies (*ex: Node.JS*).

<h2>Setup and Running the Application</h2>

This example will be using an Eclipse IDE to walk-through loading and running this project, any other IDE with Maven support will also work.


**1.** Clone or download this repository:

<code>git clone https://github.com/SpencerWie/StudentCodeSample</code>
 

**2.** Select *`File --> Import...`*, then pick the option *`Maven --> Existing Maven Projects`*. Click *Next*.

**5.** Once the project loads into the Editor simply run the Application. Then open a web broswer and input the URL `http://localhost:8080/` (*Or the port initiated by Tomcat*). That's it, the application should be fully working:
